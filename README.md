# Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones

This project utilizes machine learning techniques for human activity recognition using data collected from smartphones. The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones) and consists of 10k observations with 563 features.

## Overview

Human activity recognition is the task of clustering sequences of data collected by sensors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following information:

- **Observations**: 10,000
- **Features**: 563

The features are derived from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope signals. These features represent various aspects of motion, such as body acceleration, angular velocity, and gravitational force.
