- I would like to see interpretation of clusters during delivering the presentation. For instance, first cluster
represents people who are probably running etc... - tak
- You can look at mean, max and min of values in each cluster or similar idea. It can give you some insights to interpret clusters.
- Clustering on validator's data is great, good job.
- You can add into presentation clustering done on validator's data.
- If I see at tsne plot, I can see 3 clusters. Maybe 3 clusters? 
- 3D plot would be great to see clusters during presentation. - tak
- What did you learn from this project? Say it during presentation.
