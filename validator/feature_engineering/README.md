### Feedback
- I am not convinced that you should remove so many features.
Some of them might be important. And then you can use PCA to reduce the dimensionality.
- It seems like there is not conclusion from EDA used in feature engineering. It would be nice to see some insights from EDA used in feature engineering.
- You can try to remove columns based on correlation between them. It can help to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
- Good Job.
